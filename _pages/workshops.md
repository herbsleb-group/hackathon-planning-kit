We organize workshops to bring together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences.

<h3><a href="http://hackathon-workshop-2018.com/">The 2nd Workshop on Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events Current Trends and Next Steps in Research and Event Design</a></h3><br>
<i>Collocated with</i> ACM CHI 2018, Montreal, Canada<br>
<p p style="text-align: justify;">
Hackathons or Hackathon-style events, describe increasingly popular time-bounded intensive events across different fields and sectors. Often cited examples of hackathons include the demanding overnight competitive coding events, but there are many design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims. They offer a new form of collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and engaging with new audiences. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events and socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming in- creasingly popular. While hackathons, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent ex- amples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with di- vergent aims, such as sprints, codefests, hack-days, edit-a- thons and so on. Taken together, these events offer new op- portunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdepen- dent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers inter- ested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.<br>
