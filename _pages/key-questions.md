<p>Hackathons are meant to be intensive and fun events that motivate people to come and contribute, collaborate, and/or learn. It is thus necessary to start by thinking about motivations and expectations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why do you want to run a hackathon?</li>
    <li>What are your goals? What do you want to get out of this event?</li>
    <li>Why should people come? What will they get out of it?</li>
    <li>Who are potential participants? What is the ideal time to hold the event?</li>
    <li>Do participants know each other already? If not: How do we engage them?</li>
    <li>Do participants know the technology / approaches that will be used already? If not, then how do we:
        <ul>
            <li>Provide pre-event training so they can start right out of the gate at the hackathon, or</li>
            <li>Plan appropriate training events as part of the hackathon agenda.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How do participants form / find a project team? When should they do it?</li>
    <li>What will they do during the event? How can we make sure that they can start right out of the gate?</li>
    <li>What outcomes are expected? How do we create appropriate expectations?</li>
    <li>What are our desired follow-up activities? Do we want the projects to be continued? Do we want the community to stay intact / grow? Do we want them to spread the news?</li>
</ul>
