Hackathons are meant to be intensive and fun events that motivate people to come and contribute, collaborate, and/or learn. It is thus necessary to start by thinking about motivations and expectations:
* Why do you want to run a hackathon?
* What are your goals? What do you want to get out of this event?
* Why should people come? What will they get out of it?
* Who are potential participants? What is the ideal time to hold the event?
* Do participants know each other already? If not: How do we engage them?
* Do participants know the technology / approaches that will be used already? If not, then how do we:
  * Provide pre-event training so they can start right out of the gate at the hackathon, or
  * Plan appropriate training events as part of the hackathon agenda.
* How do participants form / find a project team? When should they do it?
* What will they do during the event? How can we make sure that they can start right out of the gate?
* What outcomes are expected? How do we create appropriate expectations?
* What are our desired follow-up activities? Do we want the projects to be continued? Do we want the community to stay intact / grow? Do we want them to spread the news?
