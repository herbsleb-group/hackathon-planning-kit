<p><b>When?</b>: Team formation or project selection typically take place at the beginning of the event after projects are presented to the participants. But organizers should also expect that some participants may join the hackathon as a team.</p>
<p><b>Who?</b>: This can be done either by participants or organizers. Specifically, participants self-select teams/projects based on their interest or organizers assign participants to the teams/projects.</p>
<p><b>How?</b>: The most common approach is self-selecting projects by participants based on interest/motivation. Another approach is assignment by organizers. In this approach, organizers identify participants’ skill sets and tasks required to complete the project, preform matching between skills, tasks, and motivations, and then assign participants to teams. It might be advisable to collect participants’ skills, interested tasks, and motivation before the event if the event features a large audience. However, the motivations and topics of assigned projects may not always be in line with the participants’ interest/motivation. The organizers therefore need to include motivation in their matching function.</p>
<p><b>Tradeoffs</b>: <ul><li>Time for preparation vs time to hack: Forming teams before the event enable teams to have more time for preparation and to hack at the event. If appropriate team formation mechanisms are in place, forming teams before the event increases the probability that teams can accomplish the greater amount of task. Even if teams are not formed before the event, it is advisable to run webinars and tutorials so participants can spend more time on their project work at the event.</li>
<li>Pre-existing vs Newly formed “flash” teams: Self-selecting teams/projects enables participants to do things that they are interested in but teams might end up not having participants with required skill sets to complete the projects and/or only having participants who have had worked together before. To address this tradeoff, it is advisable to adopt a role-based coordination in which roles are specified for each project and participants sign up for these specified roles. This still however does not guarantee that teams will have members with a mix of skills as selections were based on interest. We therefore recommend organizers to assign teams by matching pre-collected participants’ skills and interest with project requirements and by familiarity threshold. Another way to address this tradeoff is by having mentors.</li></ol></p>
