<p><b>When?</b>: Ideation typically takes place before the hackathon, but organizers can also plan for a dedicated ideation session at the beginning of the event itself.</p>
<p><b>Who?</b>: Participants typically propose their own ideas. It is however also possible to guide ideation towards a certain direction that appears feasible to the organizers and / or connected stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>How?</b>: The most common approach is for participants to develop ideas that are related to the theme(s) of the hackathon prior to the event taking place. Organizers and stakeholders can also propose specific problem (areas) that participants can address. It might also be advisable to collect ideas before the event if the event features a large audience. This allows organizers and stakeholders to pre-screen ideas and potentially adjust their ideation approach. Organizers can also facilitate ideation at the beginning of the hackathon using common approaches such as brainstorming, brainwriting or others.</p>
<p><b>Tradeoffs</b>:
  <ul><li>Priming vs open ideation: Leaving ideation completely open and in the hands of the participants can lead to them to coming up with ideas that are not or only marginally related to the goal(s) of the hackathons or with ideas that are not doable due to other constraints imposed by the setup of the hackathon (time, specialized resources, available skills, etc.). Imposing strict limitations on the ideation process by e.g. limiting participants to address specific challenges proposed by organizers or stakeholders can in turn negatively affect the motivation of participants to attend the event and take on the proposed challenged. To address this tradeoff, it is thus advisable to always leave room for participants to develop their own ideas when proposing challenges.</li>
  <li>Individual ideation vs group ideation: This tradeoff is common for most creativity techniques. Asking participants to develop ideas individually and share them after ideation has ended typically leads to more diverse ideas since people tend to follow the direction of ideas that have already been proposed. Some participants might however also benefit from others sharing their ideas because it can foster their imagination. One way of dealing with this tradeoff is to take a two-step approach by e.g. asking participants to submit individual ideas prior to the hackathon and then sharing them at the beginning of the event allowing other ideas to be added. Moreover, posing multiple (potentially contradicting) ideation themes might also help participants to come up with diverse ideas.</li>
  <li>Time for ideation vs time to hack: Conducting the ideation at the beginning of or during a hackathon provides organizers with an opportunity to steer its direction, emphasize ideas that they perceive to be best related to their goals and allows participants to develop additional related ideas. It does however also cut into the time that remains for hacking. This tradeoff becomes more problematic for larger hackathons because you want each participant to have the chance to propose ideas to keep the morale up which might not be possible for larger events. For larger events it is advisable to move ideation online or to ask participants to send ideas before the event.</li>
  <li>Too large vs too small: You want ideas to be interesting and challenging but at the same time doable during the short duration of a hackathon. One approach to deal with this trade-off would be to let participants propose wild ideas first that can then be scaled down to doable projects e.g. through mentoring.</li></ul></p>
