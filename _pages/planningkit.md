>Hackathons are time-bounded (mostly) co-located events during which a group of people engage in intense activities around a pre-set topic.

Like any other event, Hackathons require thorough planning which includes forming a leadership team, finding a date, planning a suitable venue, creating and distributing marketing material, providing support before, during and after the event, considering general logistics such as transportation, hosting, catering and others.

There are a number of guides available that cover specifics about those topics (e.g. <a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/articles/how-to-plan-an-event">https://www.wildapricot.com/articles/how-to-plan-an-event</a>).

Our hackathon plannking kit is meant to extend the basic event planning guidelines and provide insight into the specifics of Hackathons as compared to other time-bounded co-located events. Find out more about our hackathon planning kit through the following pages:
