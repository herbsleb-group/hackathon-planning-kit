Like any other event, hackathons require thorough planning which includes forming a leadership team, finding a date, planning a suitable venue, creating and distributing marketing material, providing support before, during and after the event, and considering general logistics such as transportation, hosting, catering and others.

Our hackathon planning kit focuses on tasks specific to hackathon and hence we advise organizers to refer to other available guides that cover specifics about those topics (e.g., <a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/articles/how-to-plan-an-event">https://www.wildapricot.com/articles/how-to-plan-an-event</a>).

<!-- Our hackathon plannking kit is meant to extend the basic event planning guidelines and provide insight into the specifics of Hackathons as compared to other time-bounded co-located events. Learn more about our hackathon planning kit through the following pages:
