excerpt: 'Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While hackathons&quot;, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: &quot;sprints&quot; bring together existing communities to advance planned work, &quot;code fests&quot; bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, &quot;hack-days&quot; and &quot;hack-weeks&quot; teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, &quot;edit-a-thons&quot; support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brought together: researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events. The workshop aimed to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.&quot;'

**Abstract**:Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While hackathons&quot;, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: &quot;sprints&quot; bring together existing communities to advance planned work, &quot;code fests&quot; bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, &quot;hack-days&quot; and &quot;hack-weeks&quot; teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, &quot;edit-a-thons&quot; support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brought together: researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events. The workshop aimed to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.&quot;
