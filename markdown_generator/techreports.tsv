2018-12-30	Technical Report for the 2nd Workshop on Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events.	Technical Report CMU-ISR-18-109	"In hackathons, small teams work together over a specified period of time to complete a project of interest. Such time-bounded hackathon-style events have become increasingly popular across different domains in recent years. Collegiate hackathons, just one of the many variants of hackathons, that are supported by the largest hackathon league (https://mlh.io/) alone attract over 65,000 participants among more than 200 events each year. Variously known as data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints, edit-a-thons, mapathons, and so on, such events vary depending on different audiences and with divergent aims: for example, whether teams know each other beforehand, whether the event is structured as a competition with prizes, whether the event is open or requires membership or invitations, and whether the desired outcome is primarily a product innovation, learning a new skill, forming a community around a cause, solving a technical problem that requires intensive focus by a group, or just having fun. Taken together, hackathons offer new opportunities and challenges for collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for collaborative work and engaging with new audiences. With the goal of discussing opportunities and challenges surrounding hackathons of different kinds, this one-day workshop brought together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events as socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration."

2017-08-01	Technical Report for the 1st Workshop on Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events.	Technical Report CMU-ISR	"Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While "hackathons", that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: "sprints" bring together existing communities to advance planned work, "code fests" bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, "hack-days" and "hack-weeks" teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, "edit-a-thons" support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brought together: researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events. The workshop aimed to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge."
