      "2018-07-11\tDesigning Corporate Hackathons with a Purpose\tIEEE Software\t\"In hackathons, small teams work together over a specified period of time to complete a project of interest. Hackathons have become increasingly popular as a means to surface and prototype innovative and creative ideas for products, but their impact often goes beyond product innovation. Based on our empirical studies of 10 hackathons held by scientific communities, a corporation, and universities as well as the review of published literature, we discuss that hackathons can be organized around goals such as enriching social networks, facilitating collaborative learning, and workforce development. We also discuss design choices that can scaffold the organization of hackathons and their trade-offs. Design choices include identifying a suitable mixture of attendee skills, the selection process for projects and teams, and whether to hold a competitive or collaborative event. Hackathons can achieve multiple goals if designed carefully.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Nolte, A., Filippova, A., Bird, C., Scallen, S., and Herbsleb, J.D. (2018).

      "2017-06-05\tDoes it matter how you play? The effects of collaboration and competition among players of human computation games.\tJournal of the Association of Information Science and Technology (JASIST)\t\"Human computation games (HCGs) harness human intelligence through enjoyable gameplay to address computational problems that are beyond the power of computer programs but trivial for humans. With the popularity of crowdsourcing, different types of HCGs have been developed using various gameplay mechanics to attract online users to contribute outputs. Two commonly used mechanics are collaboration and competition. Yet there is little research examining whether HCGs perform better than nongame applications in terms of motivations and perceptions. Thus, this study investigates the effects of collaborative and competitive mechanics on intrinsic motivation and perceived output quality in mobile content sharing HCGs. Using a within_subjects experiment, 160 participants were recruited from 2 local universities. The findings suggest that the nongame application was perceived to yield better quality output than both HCGs, but the latter offered a greater satisfaction of motivational needs, which may motivate individuals to continue playing them. Taken together, the present findings inform researchers and designers of HCGs that games could serve as a motivator to encourage participation. However, the usefulness of HCGs may be dependent on how one can effectively manage the entertainment-output generation duality of such games. This article concludes by presenting implications, limitations, and future research directions.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Goh, D.H.-L., and Lee, C.S. (2017). Does it matter how you play?

      "2014-01-02\tA typology of human computation games: An analysis and a review of current games\tBehaviour and Information Technology(BIT)\t\"Human computation games (HCGs) utilise human intelligence for the purpose of problem solving through games. Recently, HCGs have increased in popularity within various application areas. A proper system of describing such games is necessary in order to obtain a better understanding of the current body of work and identify new opportunities for future research directions. To date, however, there is little research conducted in understanding how such games could be classified in a systematic manner. Past classification schemes rely either on quality or entertainment aspects of these games. In order to have a deeper understanding of such games, this study argues that they should be classified via different dimensions. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing literature on HCGs and then develops a typology consisting of 12 dimensions and related strategies. This typology provides a holistic view of HCGs, and provides a common understanding of the domain among researchers and designers. The typology will help researchers to better understand the nature and consequences of HCGs, and designers better identify strengths and weaknesses of different strategies for each dimension, thus facilitating the creation of entertaining and effective HCGs.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Goh, D.H.-L., and Lee, C.S.

      "2014-07-01\tMaking work fun: Investigating antecedents of perceived enjoyment in human computation games for information sharing\tComputers in Human Behavior(BIT)\t\"The advent of online games, crowdsourcing, and user-generated content has led to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Human Computation Games (HCGs) which utilize games as a motivator to encourage users' participation in human computation. HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N=205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Goh, D.H.-L., and Lee, C.S.

      "2018-11-01\tYou Hacked and Now What?: - Exploring Outcomes of a Corporate Hackathon\tProceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI, CSCW 2018)\t\"Time bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention from practitioners and researchers. Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.\"\t\"Nolte, A., Pe-Than, E.P.P., Filippova, A., Bird, C., Scallen, S., and Herbsleb, J.D.

Despite being a brief activity, being collocated with team members and focused on a task—radical collocation—could improve collaboration of scientific software teams. Using a mixed-methods study of participants who attended two hackathons at Space Telescope Science Institute, we examined how hackathons can facilitate collaboration in scientific software teams which typically involve members from two different disciplines: science and software engineering. We found that hackathons created a focused interruption-free working environment in which team members were able to assess each other’s skills, focus together on a single project and leverage opportunities to exchange knowledge with other collocated participants, thereby allowing technical work to advance more efficiently. This study suggests “hacking” as a new and productive form of collaborative work in scientific software production.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P. and Herbsleb, J.D. (2019).

Since GitHub offers unique features that are different from traditional ways of collaborative writing, it is interesting to investigate how GitHub features are used for writing. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of a mixed-methods, case study of collaboration practices in a GitHub book project. We found that the use of GitHub depended on task interdependence and audience participation. GitHub's direct push method was used to coordinate both loosely- and tightly-coupled work, with the latter requiring collaborators to follow socially-accepted conventions. The pull-based method was adopted once the project was released to the public. While face-to-face and online meetings were prominent in the early phases, GitHub's issues became instrumental for communication and project management in later phases. Our findings have implications for the design of collaborative writing tools.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Dabbish, L., and Herbsleb, J.D. (2018).

Our recommendations are derived from the analysis of data collected through ethnographic observations, interviews, and questionnaires. Hackathons are not only a good way to foster innovation but also to provide learning and knowledge exchange opportunities, to create new and enhance existing social connections, to exercise new technical and leadership opportunities, and to get the needed work done or to make a quick progress on technical work. However, designing a hackathon involves careful upfront planning, project selection, team formation, goal setting, and follow-up activities. Before the hackathon, the organizers should ask potential participants to propose project ideas (e.g., highest priority needed work in the case of STScI), and elicit their skills, expertise, and project preference. The organizers should form teams by matching participants' skills to required skills for the projects. The resulting teams consist of a mix of members with varying levels of expertise. It is advisable for teams to perform preparatory work which includes appointing a team lead and having pre-event meetings where they discuss their plan for the event, break the projects into small individual tasks, assign tasks to team members, and familiarize themselves with the environment, project, and task. The organizers should advise teams to set realistic goals for the event and keep track of their progress toward these goals. At the end of the event, the organizers should advise teams to present their accomplishment and future plans, and encourage them to plan for future collaboration and designate a person to keep track of the progress. Examples include using the common free time to work side-by-side and self-organizing mini-hackathons (e.g., lunch hacks). With careful consideration of activities mentioned above, hackathons may provide a fruitful avenue of collaboration between astronomers and software experts.\"\t\"Pe-Than, E.P.P., Momcheva, I., Tollerud, E., and Herbsleb, J.D.

These web portals allow scientist to focus on research with little to no need to utilize programmatic skills. Hackathons are time-bounded events in which collaborators intensely focus on a given subject or problem in an effort to generate solutions. Hackathon events provide opportunities for participants with diverse backgrounds, mixed specialties, and broad skill sets to interact in a manner that promotes disruptive solutions. Hackathons come in a variety of different forms and serve many different purposes. These purposes include developing resources, infrastructure, practices, and culture for a community. The Science Gateways Community Institute team proposed a hackathon to introduce students attending the PEARC 2018 conference, to the concepts of Science Gateways. The aim of the hackathon was to stimulate interest in Science Gateways while developing projects that were of value to researchers from different disciplines. They believed that PEARC would be an ideal venue for this type of event, due to the community of researchers, students, and practitioners from various disciplines that were interested and skilled in the high-performance computing field attending the conference. The Science Gateways Community Institute utilized a hackathon formatted event to provide students with an opportunity to collaborate and generate targeted skills while creating needed features for production web portals. The student participants included a group of 17 graduate and undergraduate students with predominately underrepresented minorities. The hackathon followed the PEARC 2018 conference held in Pittsburgh, PA. The science gateways targeted during the event were MyGeoHub (Purdue University), Cosmic2 (San Diego Supercomputing Center), and SimCCS (Indiana University) with associated mentors serving as subject matter experts.
