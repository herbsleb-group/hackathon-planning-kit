<h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Welcome to the Hackathon Planning Kit. This kit provides a detailed description of 12 decision making points important for the hackathon design process including the tradeoffs among alternative design choices at each decision point. Additionally, resources from which the kit is based are also included and these involves guides from other hackathon organizers and participants, technical reports, workshop papers and proceedings, and peer-reviewed papers. Our papers contain the evidence gained from the empirical studies of hackathons held by scientific communities, a corporation, and universities.

    The kit will be useful for both first-time and experienced hackathon organizers. It will help them select the designs that fit better with their goals by weighing the tradeoffs among design choices at each decision point.
