<h1>You were always wondering what a hackathon is and if you should organize one? You came to the right place.</h1>
<p>On this website you will find information about how to design a hackathon that fits your needs. We will guide you step by step through key decisions you have to make on this journey. But lets start with the basics.</p>
<p><b><u>WHAT IS A "HACKATHON"?</u></b> A hackathon is a short intensive event during which people come together, form teams and attempt to complete a project that is of interest to them. Teams are usually collocated, and often composed of people with diverse backgrounds, experience, and expertise. To get a more concrete idea we provided links to hackathons we co-organized <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons">here</a>.
<p><b><u>HOW TO USE THIS WEBSITE:</u></b> This website is organized around 12 key designs decisions organizers have to make when planning a hackathon. For each decision, we provide information about who should be involved in the decision, when you should consider making it, how to make the choice and implement its result, and discuss potential tradeoffs among the various options.
<ul><li><i>For first-time organizers</i> we provide <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/example-timelines">example timelines</a> for two types of hackathons. These walk you through the different decision points and show you examples for how and why you could decide for one or the other option.</li>
<li><i>Experienced organizers</i> can directly access an overview of <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/design-choices">design decisions</a> and create their own timeline for a hackathon that fits their needs.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><u>ADDTITIONAL RESOURCES:</u></b> You will also find links to additional resources such as <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/guides">sample guides</a> by different organizations, information about <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/workshops">workshops</a> we conducted on the topic, and <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/peer-reviewed">academic publications</a>. The included guides provide a rich resource on how to organize the every day details of an event. They however typically assume a particular goal and a particular style of hackathon. It is thus important to adapt them to fit your needs using the decision guidelines we provide on this website.</p>
