Based on our empirical study of 14 hackathons including a large-scale corporate hackathon by Microsoft, events hosted by universities, and events hosted by scientific communities including three hack days at STScI, we provide a hackahton planning kit for three of the most common types of hackathons: <strong>communal, contributive, and catalytic</strong>. -->

This is a collaborative research project led by Institute for Software Research in Carnegie Mellon University, University of Tartu, funded by Alfred P Sloan foundation.
