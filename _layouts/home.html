<p><b>Welcome to our Hackathon Planning Kit.</b></p>
<p><i>This is an ongoing kit and we will update it as we learn more about the planning and execution of hackathons.</i></p>
<p><b>WHAT THIS IS ABOUT: </b>This site is organized around 12 key design choices an organizer must make in planning a hackathon. For each choice, we provide information about who, when, and how to make the choice, and discuss the tradeoffs among the various options.</p>
<p><b>EXAMPLE TIMELINES: </b>We also provide two example timelines reflecting different hackathon goals, and show how the tradeoffs we identified lead to different choices for hackathons aimed at community building and hackathons aimed at creating innovative products. Similar timelines can be constructed by anyone using the planning kit, after considering the design choice tradeoffs in light of the hackathon goals.</p>
<p><b>RESOURCES: </b>We also provide links to the wealth of information available on the web, indicating for the key sources the type of organizer for which they are most likely to be useful. These resources typically assume a particular goal and a particular style of hackathon. Our focus has been on tying much of this material together by talking about the design space of hackathons and guiding the designer through the key choices.</p>
<p><b>HOW TO USE IT:</b></p>
<p>If you are a first-time organizer, we suggest that you adopt either one of the example timelines that refects your goals. Here's the <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/example-timelines">page</a> that you should be looking next.</p>
<p>If you are an experienced organizer, we suggest that you construct your own timeline considing design choices listed on this <a href="{{ relative_url }}/hackathon-planning-kit/design-choices">page</a>.<p>
