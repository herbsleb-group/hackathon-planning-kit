    Welcome to the Hackathon Planning Kit. If you are comtemplating about events that foster innovation, learning, skills development, networking, get the needed work done, quick progress on technical work or fun, this planning kit will help you create the timeline and action plan for your hackathon that maximizes the probability of reaching your goals.

    This kit provides a detailed description of 12 decision making points important for the hackathon design process including the tradeoffs among alternative design choices at each decision point. Additionally, resources from which the kit is based are also included and these involves guides from other hackathon organizers and participants, technical reports, workshop papers and proceedings, and peer-reviewed papers. Our papers contain the evidence gained from the empirical studies of hackathons held by scientific communities, a corporation, and universities.
